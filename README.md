# Basic Gmail client (with some frills)
This is an implementation of a very rudimentary Gmail client using  React JS.

You may want to play around with it at https://mailor-204416.firebaseapp.com/. If the url is dead you will have to deploy it locally of course :) 

You will find this interesting if
 - you need to use [OAuth 2.0 to Access Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)
 - you need a basic understanding of the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/)  

Disclaimers :  
 1. An extra layer of AES 256 encryption is added. This is by no means fool proof; use at your own peril. If this gets serious a "super" layer of encryption will be added using PKI (Public key infrastructure). 
 2. This works only with Gmail currently. It is an experimental project to elicit feedback.  Nothing more.
