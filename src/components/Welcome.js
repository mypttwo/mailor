        <strong>Hi!</strong> Email apps are usually boring. Why use email anyway? - Unless you like promotions, official (yawn!) boring mails and spam.ðŸ˜’
        <p><strong>Good news :  this isn't another email app.</strong> Couple of things straight off - </p>
          <p><strong>mailor does not list any email that has not been sent by the mailor app.</strong> Which is why you arent seeing your other emails. <Link to={{pathname:'/compose'}}>Try sending a mail to a friend to begin with</Link></p>
          <p><strong>mailor only works with Gmail.</strong> We dont support other providers - for now.</p>
          <p><strong>mailor does not store any data on its servers.</strong> Every mail you send is stored only on your Gmail inbox.</p>
          <p><strong>This is work in progress.</strong> All normal email features are not available - and may not be in the future. However we will try to put in more interesting stuff - different from other email providers ðŸ˜Ž. <Link to={{pathname:'/suggestion'}}>Go ahead and suggest a cool feature if you have one!</Link></p>
